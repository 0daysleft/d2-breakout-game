# 2D Breakout Game

A classic 2D Breakout game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a bouncing ball that interacts with blocks in the upper area of the screen. Players need to control a paddle at the bottom to bounce the ball and hit the blocks, earning points. The goal is to prevent the ball from touching the ground while breaking all the blocks!

## Game Features

- **Bouncing Ball**: The ball bounces off the walls, blocks, and the paddle.
- **Paddle**: A movable block at the bottom of the screen that the player controls to bounce the ball back into the game area.
- **Blocks**: Multiple blocks are positioned at the top of the screen, and when the ball hits them, the block disappears, and the player earns a point.
- **Game Progress**: The game keeps track of the current score and level.
- **Losing Condition**: The game ends if the ball touches the ground. 

## How to Play

1. Use the left and right arrow keys (or mouse) to move the paddle.
2. Try to keep the ball in the air by bouncing it off the paddle.
3. Hit all the blocks to earn points.
4. Don't let the ball fall off the screen, or you will lose!

## Installation

To play the game, you can clone this repository or download the files and open `index.html` in your browser.

### Steps to run the game:

1. Clone or download the repository.

- [git clone](https://github.com/0daysleft/2d-breakout-game.git)

2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling the game layout, blocks, paddle, and ball.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, animation, and event handling.

## Game Logic

- **Ball Mechanics**: The ball's movement is controlled by velocity vectors, and it bounces off walls and blocks with a slight change in direction.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the ball and blocks, as well as the ball and the paddle. When the ball hits a block, that block is removed, and the score is updated.
- **Paddle Movement**: The paddle moves horizontally in response to player input via the arrow keys or mouse movement.
- **Score Tracking**: Each block hit adds one point to the player's score, and the game level progresses as the player clears all blocks.

## Future Improvements

- Add multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Add power-ups (e.g., multi-ball, larger paddle).
- Implement a better scoring system (e.g., time-based bonus points).
- Add a restart option when the game ends.
